# The-Intersect
Uses Spotipy to allow the user to create playlist out of the intersection of two playlists.
Also using crowd sourced tags from lastfm to classify the genre of individual songs.

Goal: to automatically build playlists for every genre of music in current library and every decade. So the user can then say for example build the intersection of 80's and rock.
